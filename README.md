RSpec Book Unofficial Updated Code (RSpec Buuc)

One of my goal’s is to get better at testing my code using RSpec. To do so, I decided to pick up ‘The RSpec Book’. I will be going through the book, however since the versions of Ruby and Gems used throughout the book are outdated, I will be updating the code samples to be inline with current versions of Ruby and Gems. I will be calling this project the RSpec Book Unofficial Updated Code or RSpec Buuc.

This repo will hold the code for those updates. I will also be blogging about it at http://www.rifaso.com

The RSpec Book Ruby and Gem Versions are:
ruby-1.8.7
rubygems- 1.3.7
rspec-2.0.0
cucumber-0.9.2
cumcumber-rails-0.3.2
database_claener-0.5.2
webrat-0.7.2
selenium-client-1.2.18
rails-3.0.0

The RSpec Buuc Ruby and Gem version I will be using are:
ruby-2.2.2
rubygems-2.4.8
rspec-3.3.0
cucumber-2.0.0
cumcumber-rails-1.4.2
database_claener-1.4.1
capybara-2.4.4
selenium-client-2.9.9
rails-4.2.3

I am doing this primarily for myself and my own learning. I am sharing and doing this publically in hopes that it may be useful to others.

I am by no means an expert, so any feedback would be appreciated.
